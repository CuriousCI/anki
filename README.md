# Anki _(as a PWA)_

With this project, I aim to build a PWA, so to **empower everyone** to _study_ and _learn_ on **every device!**

## Why tho?

To be honest, I don't like anki's UI that much _(so I'm going to take matters in my own hands)_. Plus, the 20$ pricetag on iOS shouldn't stop people who bought the wrong phone ðŸ˜‰!
It would also ensure the same _user experience_ on every device!

## Which tools and why am I using them

I'm going to build a **static web page** _(cos it's free to host on **GitHub** pages, inside the docs folder)_ which will use Anki's API ðŸ˜Š
I'll write the code in **Svelte** _(get the best results with the least effort)_ as in it's super easy to setup a static website + **TypeScript** cos I really like type safety and clean code ðŸ§¹!
I guess I'll stick to **tailwindcss** as it's always proven to be quick and super useful in every situation! _(and some CSS here and there)_
